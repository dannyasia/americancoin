Americancoin, Hell Yea
=========

The most patriotic crypto-currency ever.

Technical nonsense 
=========

a lite version of Bitcoin optimized for CPU mining using scrypt as a proof of work scheme.

<ul>
<li>2.5 minute block targets</li>
<li>subsidy halves in 840k blocks (~4 years)</li>
<li>~168 million total coins</li>
<li>100 coins per block</li>
<li>504 blocks to retarget difficulty</li>
<li>41.4% maximum change on difficulty retarget</li>
</ul>

The rest is the same as bitcoin.
